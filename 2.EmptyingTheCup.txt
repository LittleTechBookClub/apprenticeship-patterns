# Chapter 2: Emptying the Cup

1. What was your first language? Did someone help you learn it? 
2. Think of a time you had to admit you didn't know something. What was holding you back? How did it feel afterwards/what was the outcome? 
3. The authors touch on "Retreat into Competence" (this refers to taking a moment to gather your bearings when you start to feel overwhelmed by how much you yet don't know). Describe a time you felt like you needed to do this at work or in your studies. How did this help you make your next move or rebalance your mental wellness?
