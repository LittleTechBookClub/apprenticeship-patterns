# Chapter 4: Accurate Self-Assessment

1. "If you should end up with a teacher who doesn't seem right for you, first look inside. You might well be expecting more than any teacher can give." 
Can you think of a time you felt your mentor might not be as skilled as you thought they were? 
Can you think of a time when you were the mentor and your mentee felt this way?
2. Kindred Spirits is about finding peers to learn with, without feeling the pressure learning with someone you admire (aka a mentor) looking over your shoulder. 
This group is meant to be a Kindred Spirits forum. What do you think we can do yo grow and improve our community? 
(open to adding more group leads)
3. Sweep the Floor is about earning your stripes on your team by doing a simple/small task and doing it well to earn greater responsibilities. 
Can you think of a time you did this? Can you think of a time you did this and it backfired? 
(The book explains that one may become pigeonholed into a role of gopher or may never get the responsibility of bigger tasks they want).
