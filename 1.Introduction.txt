1. Do you believe that formal apprenticeship programs are feasible? How would you envision it at your organization (if you're in the industry already)? 
2. In the olden days journeymen earned expertise by being nomadic and learning under many different experts. Do you think the equivalent is changing jobs/companies? How have you sought new information and mentors?
3. Have you experienced Impostor Syndrome? How do you think it relates to Growth Mindset? 
4. Internal locus of control means believing that you have control over the outcome of events in your life. Describe a time when you experienced this and a time when you did not. What helped you experience internal locus of control and what felt like a barrier to achieving this sense of self determination?
